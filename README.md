**Data analysis is in high demand, with organisations increasingly requiring skilled staff to collect, analyse and interpret their data. The primary role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data to provide business insight. Analysts are typically involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregating data, and conducting a range of analytical studies on that data.**

The worldwide growth in the collection of data and subsequent supply of information from this data has been phenomenal. Many organisations are experiencing a shortage of the skills required to perform this analysis. This level 4 course is intended to equip you with the problem-solving skills and technical knowledge required for a career in this area.

You will explore a broad range of areas, such as problem solving, statistics, programming and systems analysis as well as databases and data analysis, analytics as well as aspects of data science allowing you to develop your professional knowledge in your area of work.

Data analysts tend to be involved in collecting, organising and analysing data to provide business insight and information for business advantage.

**Data analysis is in high demand, with organisations increasingly requiring skilled staff to collect, analyse and interpret their data. The primary role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data to provide business insight. Analysts are typically involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregating data, and conducting a range of analytical studies on that data.**

The worldwide growth in the collection of data and subsequent supply of information from this data has been phenomenal. Many organisations are experiencing a shortage of the skills required to perform this analysis. This level 4 course is intended to equip you with the problem-solving skills and technical knowledge required for a career in this area.

You will explore a broad range of areas, such as problem solving, statistics, programming and systems analysis as well as databases and data analysis, analytics as well as aspects of data science allowing you to develop your professional knowledge in your area of work.

Data analysts tend to be involved in collecting, organising and analysing data to provide business insight and information for business advantage.


We currently offer the [Level 4 Data Analyst pathway](https://www.solent.ac.uk/courses/apprenticeships/level-4-data-analyst-apprenticeship) aligned to the [Institute for Apprenticeships standard.](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/data-analyst/)

### Systems Analysis and Design Work Based Project COM423
In this module, the key components of business information systems are identified and dissected to reveal the essential elements considered in systems analysis. Theoretical approaches towards the planning and execution of effective design strategies are supported by practical case study examples. You will learn how to identify user requirements in order to analyse the functionality of systems and to produce basic design specifications for a spectrum of commercial and industrial situations. They will also be introduced to the management of project life cycles that govern the process of systems analysis.  In doing so, they will be introduced to and use software tools that are currently in wider industrial contexts

### Introduction to Cyber Security COM425
This introductory course explores cyber trends, threats—along with the broader topic of cybersecurity in a way that informs and encourages the student to investigate further. No prerequisites are required.  This zero-credit online module will take 12 to 15 hours of independent study and a certificate will be awarded on completion from Cisco. It must be completed before Gateway EPA, but we recommend apprentices complete this in the first semester of year one.

You'll Learn These Core Skills:

Learn what cybersecurity is and its potential impact to you.
Understand the most common threats, attacks and vulnerabilities.
Gain insights for how businesses protect their operations from attacks.
Find the latest job trends and why cybersecurity continues to grow.

### Computing Project COM426
This offers the opportunity to bring together knowledge and skills into a real-world-based project within the discipline of their subject area. The overall aim of this module is to offer an opportunity to demonstrate the skills required for managing and implementing a project.

### Data Analysis Gateway COM428 
This module prepares the student for the End Point Assessment (EPA). This Gateway process takes place in the last three months of the apprenticeship following completion of the 24 weeks on-programme delivery and will support the student to confidently complete the EPA.

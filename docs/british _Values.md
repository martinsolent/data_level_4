### Prevent

Prevent is one of four strands that make up the government’s counter-terrorism strategy called CONTEST. The Prevent duty is a new statutory duty to have “due regard to the need to prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism”. The Prevent duty guidance provided by the government requires universities to assess the level of risk that people may be drawn into terrorism and to have suitable policies, procedures, or arrangements in place to mitigate those risks.

On 1 April 2018 the Office for Students (OfS) took over from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in the role of regulating English higher education providers on behalf of all students, including the role of working with universities to ensure the appropriate Prevent duty policies, procedures and arrangements are in place, and following an OfS Prevent monitoring framework for this purpose.

You are required to create a portfolio of the work you have undertaken over the course of your apprenticeship. This will be the work you produced on-programme on your university modules and also work you have undertaken in your job role with your employer (that maps to the standard learning outcomes)

You just need an overarching document with a summary of each of the items you have in your portfolio and you need to map these to the learning outcomes c from the Digital and Technology Solutions apprenticeship standard which is broken down into core skills and skills that belong to your specialism (pathway).

You have already been assessed on all the work you submitted on the course, but it is a requirement of the apprenticeship that you do complete a portfolio of your work and that is then checked when you move into EPA and gateway, it is also used when the University is inspected as a training provider,

You will be offered support and guidance in the final Synoptic Project Module COM625 and in following the Gateway EPA period, but to support the mapping process learning outcomes for both the core and specialism skills for each of the pathways.

# Extenuating Circumstances

**Extenuating Circumstances (EC) and personal matters that may impact your learning**

The University recognises that from time to time you may experience personal circumstances which will make it difficult for you to attend class or submit your assessments on time.

Those circumstances may be short term or longer-term and there are a number of ways the University can help you.

It is vitally important you let us know you have problems as soon as possible so we can advise on the best course of action for your particular circumstances. We cannot normally take retrospective action; so telling us about your problems at the end of the year, or after your results have been released, is too late for us to help you. Make sure you speak to someone at the Student Hub as soon as you think you might be having difficulties. They will be able to guide you to the appropriate support.

The following are the main ways in which the University can offer help to students who are experiencing personal problems that affect their ability to study.

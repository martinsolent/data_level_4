# EPA Assessment Method 1 - Part 2

**Assessment method 1:** 

Project with presentation and questioning (This assessment method has two components.)

**Assessment method 1 component 2:**

**Presentation with Questioning**


## Overview

Apprentices will prepare and deliver a presentation that appropriately covers the KSBs assigned to this method of assessment.

The presentation will be based on the project and will cover:

* a summary of the main aspects of the project
* context/ implications/recommendations from the project
* practical application of knowledge, skills and behaviours
* business recommendations/ outcomes of the project, including visualisations
* any follow-on outcomes
* actions and next steps

The presentation will be completed and submitted after the gateway within 8 weeks of the EPA start date typically at the same time as the project report is submitted to the EPAO. The presentation will be presented to an independent assessor, either face-to-face or via online video conferencing. The apprentice will have 10 days’ notice of the presentation date to prepare for the presentation.

### The rationale for this assessment method is:
The presentation is part of the overall "project with presentation and questioning" assessment method. The rationale for the use of the presentation element is that it replicates the work undertaken by competent individuals in the profession, where clearly communicating complex issues to non-technical and technical audiences is required.

### Delivery
The presentation with questioning will last for 40 minutes. The presentation will typically last for 20 minutes and the questions and answers will typically last for 20 minutes. The questions will be held following the presentation. The independent assessor has the discretion to increase the time of both the presentation and questioning by up to 10% to allow the apprentice to complete their last point. During this method, the independent assessor must use questions from a question bank as well as generate their own questions. A minimum of 8 questions must be asked.

The presentation with questioning will be conducted as set out here:

* The presentation will take place on a one-to-one basis between the assessor and the apprentice.
* The way in which the content of the presentation is delivered is not prescriptive.
* A copy of the project presentation material must be sent to the EPAO within 8 weeks of the EPA start date, and the apprentice must outline details of visual aids to be used and specify any equipment required for the presentation.
* The independent assessor will review the project in advance of the presentation and prepare questions to be used at the end of the presentation.
* The presentation will be assessed holistically as part of the overall project with presentation and questioning assessment method.
* The independent assessor will make the grading decision based on all of the components in the assessment method.
* The independent assessor must use the assessment tools and procedures that are set by the EPAO to record the presentation with questioning
* The independent assessor will make all grading decisions. Venue The presentation with questioning should take place in a quiet room, free from distractions and influence

**The presentation with questioning can take place in any of the following:**

* employer’s premises
* a suitable venue selected by the EPAO (for example a training provider's premises)
* **online via video conferencing**
 
The presentation may be conducted face-to-face or via an electronic platform e.g. videoconferencing. EPAOs must ensure appropriate methods to prevent misrepresentation are in place should an electronic option be used, for example, screen share and 360-degree camera function with the independent assessor present.

The venue shall have access to appropriate resources to conduct the assessment such as robust IT equipment and infrastructure to enable effective use of any technology used.

Other relevant information Questions relating to the underpinning KSBs, must be varied yet allow assessment of the relevant KSBs.

Independent assessors must be developed and trained by the EPAO in the conduct of presentations with questioning and reaching consistent judgement. EPAOs will produce the following material to support this assessment method:

* outline of the assessment method’s requirements
* marking / grading materials
* overview of the typical titles of projects
* question bank

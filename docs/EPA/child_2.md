The Endpoint Assessment takes place in the final 3 months of the apprenticeship following on from the "on-programme" delivery.

**To move into the EPA period you need to have completed and submitted the off-the-job tracker, Portfolio, EPA ready form & Employer feedback reference - these will need to be checked before the final EPA assessment can be booked.**  
  
We will encourage apprentices and their employers to think about suitable project areas for the synoptic project end of the 2nd year and the beginning of the 3rd year as you should spend approximately 6 months preparing and working on your project.

Support for the synoptic project takes place in the final COM625 module which will also prepare you for gateway EPA in completing your portfolio, gathering all required documents, and creating a "dry run" presentation.

# EPA Assessment Method 1 - Part 1

**Assessment method 1:** 

Project with presentation and questioning (This assessment method has two components.)

**Assessment method 1 component 1:**

Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The project is compiled after the apprentice has gone through the gateway.

The work-based project should be designed to ensure that the apprentice’s work meets the needs of the business, is relevant to their role and allows the relevant KSBs to be demonstrated for the EPA.

The project will be designed to give the Data Analyst the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to the assessment method within their day to day work and may cover the following project ideas to enable them to demonstrate competence (these are examples and other relevant project ideas are permitted):

* Patterns / trends and predictions
* Presenting statistical analysis results to inform decisions
* Optimising data models using statistical measures

The employer will ensure it has a real business application and the EPAO will ensure it meets the requirements of the EPA (including suitable coverage of the KSBs assignment to this assessment method).

Given the large number of projects that will be completed per year, EPAOs will not be expected to signoff each project title before the project commences. However, the EPAO should instead provide detailed specifications and suggested project titles to enable the employer to select a suitable project that will meet the requirements of the EPA.

### The rationale for this assessment method is:

Data analysts work in a project-based environment and are responsible for collating, analysing and presenting data to a range of stakeholders. The project will address a data analysis task tailored to the organisational requirements of the apprentice’s employer which reflects the normal working practices within the role. As part of the role they will be expected to complete project reports and the project will reflect the areas their report would cover within their industry. By using this assessment method, the apprentice will be able to demonstrate not only their analytical skills but also their use of varied methods of presenting data analysis outputs and their ability to distil key data analysis findings into a presentation. The questioning element allows the apprentice an opportunity to provide further detailed evidence to support their demonstration of the mapped KSBs to this method.


### Delivery
Apprentices will conduct a project and submit an electronic report.

The project is compiled after the apprentice has gone through the gateway. The apprentice will conduct their project and submit it to the EPAO after a maximum of 8 weeks of the EPA start date. The project itself will typically take 6 weeks and the report write up a further 2 weeks.

The employer will ensure the apprentice has sufficient time and the necessary resources, within this period, to plan and undertake the project.

Whilst completing the project, the apprentice should be subject to the supervision.

### Normal workplace supervision
The project should be submitted in the form of an electronic report and should comprise an explanatory narrative which sets out the tasks undertaken as well as accompanying visual infographics. As a minimum all project outputs must include:

* an introduction
* the scope of the project (including key performance indicators)
* project outcomes and how the outcomes were achieved
* a project plan
* consideration of legislation, regulation, industry and organisational policies, procedures and requirements
* analysis
* research and findings
* recommendations and conclusions

The project report should acknowledge sources.
The project report has a maximum word limit of 3,500. A tolerance of plus or minus 10% is allowed.

Appendices, references, diagrams etc. will not be included in this total.

The project must map, in an appendix, how it evidences the relevant KSBs for this assessment method.

The apprentice will need to consider the availability of company and external resources required to complete the project. They must also ensure they are fully aware of the KSBs the project is intended to assess as that is what the grading of the project will be based on. The apprentice may work as part of a team which could include technical internal or external support however the report will be the apprentice’s own work and will be reflective of their own role and contribution.

When the project is submitted, the employer and the apprentice should verify the submitted work is that of the apprentice.

### Marking
The independent assessor will review and mark the project in a timely manner, as determined by the EPAO, and without extending the EPA unnecessarily. Similarly, all quality control processes will also be conducted in a timely manner, as determined by the EPAO.

EPAOs will produce the following material to support this assessment method:

* Outline of the assessment method’s requirements
* Marking materials
* Examples of projects

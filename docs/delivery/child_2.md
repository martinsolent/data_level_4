# Introduction to Networks & Security COM412



### Why is this module important?

If you think digital networks are important now, soon there will be over 50 billion connections between people, places and things. Get a VIP pass to your future.

Networking knowledge will enhance your career in any field, because every organization relies on connectivity for success. With the right skills, you can embark on a well-paid career in information and communications technology. You can choose to join a high-tech firm or bring these skills to a different field that you love, or even start your own company.

### What you will learn on the module

Firstly we will explore networks by using a network simulator to learn what devices and connections are used. We will then understand and apply the principles of networking, protocols and associated technologies by doing various online activities. We will learn the structure and contents of network models by reading online materials and testing knowledge with mini online quizzes. 

You will then practise the maths required to be a network engineer by calculating addressing schemes. We will Investigate compare and contrast transport protocols, discover what network services are necessary and apply them. 

You will also learn how to install and configure network components, including switches and routers and firewalls by doing practical activities with real equipment. 

You will apply structured approaches to troubleshooting network issues and repair faults in hardware, software products and the network and communicate effectively with your colleagues in a variety of situations. 

You will also apply diagnostic tools and techniques to identify the causes of network performance issues developing analytical skills. You will also manage network devices and apply configurations for management access control. 

You will identify attacks concepts techniques and the approach of cybersecurity and compare types of malware, you will learn how to protect your data, privacy and the cybersecurity domain and compare the tools and methods for incident response, prevention and detection.

# Apprenticeships - Reviews

Tripartite review meetings take place regularly throughout the apprenticeship and usually take place every 12 weeks (approx.)

At tripartite review meetings the apprentice, their employer, and an academic formally meet to assess progress and ensure that the apprentice is on track both in terms of their academic programme and their work-based learning. 

The review meetings will track progress against the knowledge, skills and behaviours gained in the apprenticeship.  They provide an opportunity to agree on any changes required to the apprenticeâ€™s learning plan and identify any actions needed to ensure the success of the apprenticeship.

Review meetings are undertaken by Kenton Wheeler and Martin Reid

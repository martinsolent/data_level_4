*Before an apprenticeship begins, the main training provider must conduct an initial assessment. They will assess the individual’s prior learning to establish the ‘starting point’, or baseline, for the apprentice. This informs how much of the apprenticeship training content the individual requires. *

> **EDUCATION & SKILLS FUNDING AGENCY., 2021.** Apprenticeships: initial assessment to recognise prior learning [viewed 11 July 2022]. Available from:[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-recognition-of-prior-learning/apprenticeships-initial-assessment-to-recognise-prior-learning](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-recognition-of-prior-learning/apprenticeships-initial-assessment-to-recognise-prior-learning)
 
The admissions tutor for apprenticeships will discuss prior learning at the interview and give all the information needed to complete the form.

Once an apprentice has completed the form and created appendices of evidence this will be checked by the admissions tutor before being passed on to Student Registry where it will go to a panel who will review the evidence and the documentation offered before making their decision

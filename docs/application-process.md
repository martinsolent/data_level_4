To study for an apprenticeship, **you must be employed by a sponsoring organisation.** The specific entry requirements will be agreed with your employer. 

Employers please enquire through our apprenticeship team **apprenticeships@solent.ac.uk**

## Entry Requirements

You must have Level 2 GCSE (or equivalent) English and Mathematics at level C or above.

If you do not have grade C in English and Maths you will be required to do Functional Skills in both these subjects before you are able to go to go to End Point Assessment (EPA) at the end of your Apprenticeship

**Recommended grades**

A GCSE grade 9 - 4 (previously A * - C) or equivalent in English and a GCSE grade 9 - 4 (previously A * - C) or equivalent in mathematics.
Individual employers will set the selection criteria, but this is likely to include three ‘A’ levels (including maths), although some employers will accept other relevant qualifications or experience.

## Uploading Documents

You will be asked to upload a number of documents including personal statement, CV, job description, copy of your passport and your academic/professional certificates.

### Initial assessment
You will also need to complete, and upload a self-assessment to make sure we will be up-skilling. This is what is known as **Initial Assessment**. It will assess prior learning to establish the ‘starting point’, or baseline, for the apprentice. This informs how much of the apprenticeship training content the individual requires. It checks that the apprenticeship is an appropriate training programme for the individual and is about the whole standard.
